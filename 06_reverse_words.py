Question:
Given an input string s, reverse the string word by word.
For example, given s = "the sky is blue", return "blue is sky the".
Example Questions Candidate Might Ask:
Q: What constitutes a word?
A: A sequence of non-space characters constitutes a word.
Q: Does tab or newline character count as space characters?
A: Assume the input does not contain any tabs or newline characters.
Q: Could the input string contain leading or trailing spaces?
A: Yes. However, your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing
spaces.
Q: How about multiple spaces between two words?
A: Reduce them to a single space in the reversed string.

Solution:
O(n) runtime, O(n) space:
One simple approach is a two-pass solution: First pass to split the string by
spaces into an array of words, then second pass to extract the words in
reversed order.
We can do better in one-pass. While iterating the string in reverse order,
we keep track of a wordâ€™s begin and end position. When we are at the beginning
of a word, we append it.
