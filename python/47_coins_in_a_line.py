Question:
There are n coins in a line. (Assume n is even). Two players take turns
to take a coin from one of the ends of the line until there are no more
coins left. The player with the larger amount of money wins.
1. Would you rather go first or second? Does it matter?
2. Assume that you go first, describe an algorithm to compute the maximum
amount of money you can win.

Hints:
If you go first, is there a strategy you can follow which prevents you
from losing? Try to consider how it matters when the number of coins
is odd vs. even.
