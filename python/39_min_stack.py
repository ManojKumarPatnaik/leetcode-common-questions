Question:
Design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving
the minimum element in constant time.
- push(x) – Push element x onto stack.
- pop() – Removes the element on top of the stack.
- top() – Get the top element.
- getMin() – Retrieve the minimum element in the stack.
Hints:
- Consider space-time tradeoff. How would you keep track of
the minimums using extra space?
- Make sure to consider duplicate elements.
